Harrison left the game with 6:59 left in the second quarter after the back of his head hit the turf following a 21-yard catch. He sat on the ground for a few moments and then went to the sideline. Trainers led him to the blue injury tent, where he was initially evaluated for a concussion. He later walked to the locker room and was ruled out at the start of the second half. He had two catches for 32 yards before leaving the game. Harrison suffered a concussion in Week 6 last season but returned the next week. Sunday's game was Harrison's first in Indianapolis, where his father was a Hall of Famer for the Colts. The younger Harrison had called the matchup \"a special game for me, for sure\" earlier in the week.",
