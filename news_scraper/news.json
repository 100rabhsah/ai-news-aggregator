He also criticised key OBC netas and NCP chief Sharad Pawar. The march was organised to oppose Maharashtra government's September 2 goverment resolution (GR) on reservations. \"This is not an OBC march. It is a Congress rally organised for political gains. It seems the parties in office and the opposition are conspiring against our reservation,\" Jarange said. Warning the state goverment against withdrawing reservation, Jarange said, \"If the goverment is considering this, we will not spare it. Why are they suddenly feeling their share in reservation is getting reduced because of the inclusion of Marathas? Why did they not react when many other castes were included in OBC?\"\n\nEnd of Article",
