Stevenson, who moved up in weight to challenge Lopez and make his debut at junior welterweight, won by scorecards of 119-109, 119-109 and 119-109. Stevenson (25-0, 11 KOs) is now a world champion in a fourth division after previous titles at featherweight, junior lightweight and lightweight. He was coming off  a dominant victory over William Zepeda  in July. Lopez (22-2, 13 KOs) had won six straight fights since  his upset loss to George Kambosos Jr.  in 2021. A former unified lightweight champion, Lopez was making his fourth defense of the 140-pound belt he captured with a  unanimous decision win over Josh Taylor  in June 2023. Lopez also owns notable victories  over Vasiliy Lomachenko  in 2020 and  Arnold Barboza Jr. last May . Relive all the action, undercard results and round-by-round analysis from Andreas Hale.",
