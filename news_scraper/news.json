But it was one weight class heavier where the fight card impacted the ESPN divisional MMA rankings. Lightweight  Benoît Saint Denis  knocked out  Dan Hooker  in the co-main event to move up three spots to No. 7. And in the fight right before that,  Mauricio Ruffy  scored a knockout of  Rafael Fiziev  to earn a place in the top 10. Those were the only changes in the rankings. Here are the  ESPN pound-for-pound MMA rankings  and a  list of current UFC champions  in all weight classes. Results are current; rankings as of Feb. 3. To be eligible for the rankings, a fighter must have competed over the past 12 months or must have an upcoming fight booked. Fighters who have been dropped for inactivity can be reinstated only after they compete.",
