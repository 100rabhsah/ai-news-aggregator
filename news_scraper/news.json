He was a devout Catholic, yet his personal life was a whirlwind of extramarital affairs, including a rumored relationship with Marilyn Monroe. He was a Cold War warrior, taking America to the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis, yet he spoke of peace and sought diplomacy with the Soviet Union. For many Americans, Kennedy was the embodiment of youthful optimism, of a nation on the cusp of greatness. But behind the glamour of Camelot, there were shadows—secrets within his administration, tensions with intelligence agencies, and enemies both at home and abroad.",
