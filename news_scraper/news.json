(0:29) The  New York Mets  have demoted struggling catcher  Francisco Alvarez  to Triple-A Syracuse, the team announced Sunday. Catcher  Hayden Senger  was promoted to the majors in a corresponding move to become the backup to now-primary catcher  Luis Torrens . The moves come after Alvarez went 2-for-5 with a home run in the Mets'  11-4 Saturday night victory  over the  Philadelphia Phillies , which snapped New York's seven-game losing streak. Alvarez, however, has struggled at the plate this season, hitting .236 with three home runs and 11 RBIs in 35 games. He has an OPS of .652 with 38 strikeouts. The Mets (46-31) enter Sunday night's game against the Phillies (46-31) tied for first place in the National League East standings.",
