    "content": "Saturday's UFC 325 was headlined by a meeting between the No. 1-ranked featherweight, champion  Alexander Volkanovski , and No. 2  Diego Lopes , a fight won by the champ. But it was one weight class heavier where the fight card impacted the ESPN divisional MMA rankings. Lightweight  Benoît Saint Denis  knocked out  Dan Hooker  in the co-main event to move up three spots to No. 7. And in the fight right before that,  Mauricio Ruffy  scored a knockout of  Rafael Fiziev  to earn a place in the top 10. Those were the only changes in the rankings. Here are the  ESPN pound-for-pound MMA rankings  and a  list of current UFC champions  in all weight classes. Results are current; rankings as of Feb. 3. To be eligible for the rankings, a fighter must have competed over the past 12 months or must have an upcoming fight booked. Fighters who have been dropped for inactivity can be reinstated only after they compete.",
