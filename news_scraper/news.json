Perhaps most alarming, deaths of despair—suicides, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related deaths—are still rising in the US, even as they decline in other countries. The most disillusioned group isn’t Trump or Biden supporters but abstainers—those who don’t vote at all—who report the lowest levels of happiness and the highest levels of alienation.
