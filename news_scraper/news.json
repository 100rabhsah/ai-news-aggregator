According to Zillow, that's actually a discount from the original listing in 2024 at $67,500,000. The house has four bedrooms and five bathrooms and is 3,795 square feet. It's on the waterfront in Malibu's exclusive Paradise Cove neighborhood right off Pacific Coast Highway. Photos of the property on Zillow show a well-lit interior with high ceilings and a phenomenal view of the ocean. Perhaps most unusually, the property also features a self-contained second house -- a cabana-style building on the sand. Chelios bought the house in 2001 for $5.25 million, per Zillow.",
