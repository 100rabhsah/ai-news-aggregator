    "content": "In American sports, NBA players earn significantly more than NFL players. The average NBA salary is about $11.91 million, much higher than the NFL's $2.8 to $3.2 million. Smaller NBA rosters and revenue distribution favor basketball. NBA stars like Stephen Curry earn huge amounts. The NFL's larger teams and shorter careers contribute to lower pay. The NBA's global appeal boosts player earnings.",
