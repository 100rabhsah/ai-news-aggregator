In Fisher's first season at the helm, Temple finished 16-20 overall, but peaked toward the end of the season.

Temple went 17-15 overall last season, finishing 9-9 in the league and beating regular-season champion  Memphis  in January. Temple has started 3-1 this season. Before taking over at Temple, Fisher spent two seasons as the associate head coach under Micah Shrewsberry at  Penn State  and six seasons as an assistant coach at  Miami  under Jim Larranaga.",
