There is no place for terror sympathizers or anti-national elements in Jammu and Kashmir police,” an official said. Meanwhile, police continued inspections of SIM card vending outlets across Kathua district for the second consecutive day on Sunday. “This initiative aims to strengthen the verification process for new SIM registrations and curb the potential misuse of mobile connectivity,” the official added. Vendors were instructed to maintain accurate records of all transactions and strictly follow procedures for collecting and verifying identity documents such as Aadhaar cards, voter IDs, and other valid proofs. SSP Mohita Sharma said negligence or non-compliance with KYC guidelines could invite strict action, including legal proceedings.\n\nEnd of Article",
