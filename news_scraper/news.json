    "content": "Which brings us to Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and the now-infamous “Kill Them All” directive. The mainstream American commentariat is working overtime to portray his alleged order — to eliminate the two survivors clinging to the wreckage of a bombed Caribbean vessel — as a shocking departure from established norms.
