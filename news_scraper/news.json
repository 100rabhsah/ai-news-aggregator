    "content": "The defending US Open champions on the men's and women's sides are at or near the top of the odds for the tournament's 145th edition in their quests to repeat. Jannik Sinner , who won the Wimbledon men's singles championship last month, is +105 to claim his second US Open title in a row.  Carlos Alcaraz , his opponent in the Wimbledon final, is the second choice at +180. On the women's side,  Iga Swiatek  (+250), this year's Wimbledon champ and the 2022 US Open winner, is a slight favorite over defending champion  Aryna Sabalenka  (+270) in the final Grand Slam of the year. Singles play runs Sunday through Sept. 7, with ESPN providing coverage of the event on its networks. The women's final will be played Saturday, Sept. 6 at  4 p.m. ET on ESPN , and the men's final takes place the following day at 2 p.m. ET on ABC. Every tournament match will stream live on the ESPN App.",
