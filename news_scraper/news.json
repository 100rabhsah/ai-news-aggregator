    "content": "NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force flypast stole the spotlight at the 77th Republic Day parade, captivating spectators from start to finish. The aerial segment began with a ceremonial flower shower and continued through a series of meticulously coordinated formations showcasing the IAF’s speed, precision and combat readiness. A total of 29 aircraft participated in this year’s Republic Day flypast, including 16 fighter jets, four transport aircraft and nine helicopters. The platforms operated out of five different bases, reflecting the scale of planning and coordination involved in executing the aerial display. Following the event, the Indian Air Force shared the IAF perspective videos from the air show and flypast. Four Mi-17 1V helicopters from the 129 Helicopter Unit will conduct the ceremonial showering of flower petals in the Dhwaj Formation. Led by Group Captain Alok Ahlawat, the formation will troop the National Flag as part of the Republic Day aerial segment.",
