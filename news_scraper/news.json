Taking up an appeal by Flipkart against a March 4, 2020, NCLAT order, a three-judge bench headed by CJI Surya Kant said it would be proper if the tribunal decided afresh whether a probe was necessary to be conducted in a 2018 complaint, which accused the e-commerce platform of resorting to predatory pricing. Fair-trade regulator CCI had rejected the complaint by All India Online Vendors Association. However, on appeal, NCLAT had asked CCI to conduct a probe on the complaint. In Dec 2020, SC had stayed the NCLAT order.\n\nEnd of Article",

    "content": "Jairam Ramesh\n\nNEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Tuesday summoned Congress’s Jairam Ramesh, Pawan Khera and Ragini Nayak in a criminal defamation case filed by India TV chairman and editor-in-chief Rajat Sharma. Magistrate Devanshi Janmeja of Saket court noted there were “sufficient grounds” to summon the three on July 27. The summons direct the three to respond to charges under IPC sections 465 (forgery), 471 (using forged document or electronic record), and 499 and 500 (criminal defamation). The complaint stems from allegations by Nayak in June 2024 that Sharma used “derogatory language” against her during a live TV debate. Sharma said the accusations were based on a tampered video containing captions not part of the original broadcast. Sharma said the video was circulated on X by Nayak and amplified by Khera and Ramesh, causing “reputational harm”.\n\nEnd of Article",

But it was one weight class heavier where the fight card impacted the ESPN divisional MMA rankings. Lightweight  Benoît Saint Denis  knocked out  Dan Hooker  in the co-main event to move up three spots to No. 7. And in the fight right before that,  Mauricio Ruffy  scored a knockout of  Rafael Fiziev  to earn a place in the top 10. Those were the only changes in the rankings.
