    "content": "Watch some of the action from the preseason game between the Fever vs. the Mystics. (0:47) Indiana Fever  guard  Caitlin Clark  missed Saturday's WNBA exhibition opener with a left leg injury. The move was considered precautionary as the Fever also play in an exhibition at Iowa on Sunday (4 p.m. ET, ESPN) in a homecoming game for Clark. Clark initially was listed as questionable for Saturday and warmed up before the game against the  Washington Mystics  in Indianapolis. She was announced as out just before the game started and watched from the bench. Clark, a first-team All-WNBA pick and Rookie of the Year last season, played in all 40 regular-season games and both playoff games in 2024. She averaged 19.2 points, 8.4 assists and 5.7 rebounds. At Iowa, where she became the all-time Division I scoring leader from 2020-2024, Clark never missed a game. She started all 139, averaging 34.8 minutes, 28.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.1 rebounds.",
