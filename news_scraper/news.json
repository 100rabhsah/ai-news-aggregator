After a marathon \"street fight\" match, Rhodes won his title back from the legend Cena. After the match, Brock Lesnar made his return to the WWE, delivering an F-5 to a stunned Cena. That was the final of many title matches on Night 2. Naomi retained her title in the opening match of the card, and Becky Lynch retained hers with a win over Lyra Valkyria. Later, Solo Sikoa outlasted Jacob Fatu in a steel cage match to retain the United States Championship, and Dominik Mysterio held on to the men's Intercontinental Championship with a win over AJ Styles.
