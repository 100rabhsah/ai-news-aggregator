O'Neal is joined by 96 OVR Pink Diamond versions of  Dallas Mavericks  star  Kyrie Irving  and women's basketball legend Swin Cash. Cash's pedigree is especially impressive, as she is a three-time WNBA Champion, two-time Olympic gold medal winner and FIBA Women's World Champion. Combined with her two NCAA Women's Champions, she's one of only eleven players to have collected all of these titles. The trio is accompanied by players such as Diamond Tim Duncan and  Pete Maravich , who both sport 94 OVR. Players can obtain Old School items from the program's packs and gain an extra reward for completing the entire collection in the form of a Ruby Jerry Sloan coach card for their team.",
