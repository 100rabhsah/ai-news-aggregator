    "content": "Matthew Stafford's late touchdown pass to Colby Parkinson gives the Rams a 34-31 win over the Panthers. (1:23) X-rays on the finger of  Los Angeles Rams  quarterback  Matthew Stafford  came back negative Sunday. Stafford underwent additional testing a day after a finger on his right (throwing) hand bent backward during the Rams' 34-31 victory over the  Carolina Panthers  in the NFC wild-card round Saturday. He hurt it after hitting the arm of a Panthers defender while attempting a pass late in the first half. The MVP candidate said he was able to finish the game in part because of \"adrenaline.\" \"It wasn't pleasant,\" he said Saturday. \"It wasn't great. We'll see what it is.\" Stafford went 24-of-42 for 304 yards with three touchdowns and an interception, helping the Rams (13-5) advance to the NFC divisional round.",

    "content": "Chethan Kumar is a Senior Assistant Editor with the Times of India. Aside from specialising in Space & Science, he has reported extensively on varied topics, with special focus on defence, policy and data stories. He has covered multiple elections, too.
