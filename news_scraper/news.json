Jacob Fatu joined the fun and attacked McIntyre, with& Bron Breakker closing \"SmackDown\" by spearing Rhodes and Zayn. Earlier in the show, Carmelo Hayes defended his United States Championship against Rey Fenix in an open challenge match, AJ Styles and Gunther traded verbal jabs on the mic, and the team of Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss defeated Liv Morgan and Roxanne Perez from The Judgement Day.
