Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said Ramdas Kadam was pointing a finger at chairperson of the legislative council Ram Shinde. Yogesh Kadam, who belongs to the Sena, met deputy CM Eknath Shinde on Friday and briefed him on the issue. Dy CM Ajit Pawar said the gun licence wasn't actually given by the Pune police commissioner and he would not allow any kind of interference in this matter.

He also criticised key OBC netas and NCP chief Sharad Pawar. The march was organised to oppose Maharashtra government's September 2 goverment resolution (GR) on reservations. \"This is not an OBC march. It is a Congress rally organised for political gains. It seems the parties in office and the opposition are conspiring against our reservation,\" Jarange said. Warning the state goverment against withdrawing reservation, Jarange said, \"If the goverment is considering this, we will not spare it. Why are they suddenly feeling their share in reservation is getting reduced because of the inclusion of Marathas?
