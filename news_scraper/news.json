The pigeon, caught in Kharah Balli village, was bearing coded markings, police said. The bird was first noticed by a 13-year-old boy, whose parents informed the police. “The pale grey pigeon is having red and yellow rings in legs inscribed with “Rehmat Sarkar” along with a mobile number and a name, followed by certain numbers, besides stamped wings,” police sources said. Additionally, a stamp was observed on the wings mentioning “Nowshera Aling Pigeon Club”, they said. Meanwhile, locals of Gorkha Nagar on Saturday noticed an object suspected to be a drone lying near a nallah in the area.
