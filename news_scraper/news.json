    "content": "Representative image\n\nJAIPUR: A traffic cop trying to stop an errant truck driver inside a no-entry zone in Jaipur clung to the speeding vehicle’s bonnet for nearly 500 metres as the offender accelerated and swerved multiple times in a bid to throw him off, leaving witnesses bracing for the worst. The nerve-wracking scene, which unfolded around 8.30am on Sunday at the Gurdwara Mod intersection under Adarsh Nagar police station, climaxed with some motorists blocking the truck’s way. Head constable Rampal, 52, was shaken but emerged unscathed from what might have been a horrible outcome had he slipped and fallen. A police team arrived shortly after to arrest the driver, identified as Raghuveer Singh of Lakshmangarh in Sikar, and confiscate the truck. Investigators said the driver appeared intoxicated and was taken for medical tests. They intend to press charges of rash driving and attempted murder based on an FIR registered at Adarsh Nagar police station.\n\nEnd of Article",
