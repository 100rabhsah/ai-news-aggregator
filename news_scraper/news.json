The move, officials say, is aimed at ensuring only highly skilled workers are hired while boosting U.S. revenue. For Indian professionals, who make up the majority of H-1B holders, the change raises uncertainty around jobs and green card hopes. A proposed 25% outsourcing tax could add further pressure on India’s $220 billion IT export industry.",
