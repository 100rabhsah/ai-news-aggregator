My brother was driving the rickshaw when Akshay Kumar's Innova and a Mercedes were behind it. When the Mercedes hit the Innova, the Innova crashed into the rickshaw. As a result, my brother and another passenger were trapped under it. The entire rickshaw was destroyed, and my brother is in very serious condition. My only request is that my brother receives proper treatment and that compensation is provided for the damage to the rickshaw.
