(1:04) College football's transfer portal officially opened at midnight ET on Jan. 2. However, players have been announcing their intentions to transfer since the regular season ended. By midday on Day 1, more than 4,500 Division I college football players have entered the transfer portal. Players now have until Jan. 16 to enter their name to transfer. It doesn't mean they have to find their new schools by then -- or that they can't return to their previous schools. We are tracking the notable players entering the portal as well as those players who will re-sign with their current schools. Here's the latest news and updates on how the 2026 season could be transformed.",
