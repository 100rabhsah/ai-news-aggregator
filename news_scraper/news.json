    "content": "IMPHAL: Over 150 metres of fence in newly constructed section along Myanmar border in Manipur’s Chandel district was cut in the second instance of such a security breach in the state in four months. Officials said they had zeroed in on the suspects but declined to reveal their identities, citing ongoing investigations. The “sabotage” was detected during an inspection on Wednesday. Around 64 hollow circular poles and fencing panels, along with some other accessories, were ripped and yanked off, the officials said. The damage has raised serious questions about vigilance and effectiveness of forces patrolling the border. The previous such breach was detected in Aug this year. The Centre has undertaken extensive efforts to secure the Myanmar frontier, with Border Roads Organisation (BRO) carrying out fencing across vulnerable stretches. An FIR was filed over the latest breach. Security has been tightened in the area.\n\nEnd of Article",

    "content": "Representative image\n\nNEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a plea filed by Swamy Shraddananda — who is undergoing imprisonment for rest of his natural life for killing his wife — seeking direction to govt to take an early decision on his mercy plea. A bench of Justices JK Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi asked the petitioner to approach the Karnataka govt for his grievances. Advocate Varun Thakur, appearing for the petitioner, then withdrew the plea to approach the state govt. Shraddananda, 84, alias Murali Manohar Mishra, whose wife was the grand-daughter of a former ‘dewan’ of the princely state of Mysore, had sought a review of the July 2008 verdict of a three-judge SC bench. The apex court had last year refused to entertain a petition filed by Shraddananda, seeking a review of the verdict, which had directed he should remain in prison for the rest of his life.\n\nEnd of Article",
