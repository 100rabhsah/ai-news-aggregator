United are pushing to get the deal done as quickly as possible. They've already agreed to trigger the £62.5m release clause in  Matheus Cunha 's contract at Wolves. The Brazilian will formally complete his move to Old Trafford after the international break. Mbeumo, who scored 20  Premier League  goals last season, is next on Ruben Amorim's list as he looks to cure his team's goalscoring problems.
