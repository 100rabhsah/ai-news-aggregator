Act two is the troll war. Act three, if it comes, will be 2028 ‚Äî where Gavin Newsom will either be remembered as the liberal who cosplayed Trump for a season or the Democrat who figured out how to use memes to win power. Could he be the Lyndon Johnson of the meme era ‚Äî underestimated, even mocked, until history forced him into greatness? That remains unanswered. But for now, MAGA finally knows what it feels like to be on the receiving end of ridicule. And Gavin Newsom is laughing loudest.",
