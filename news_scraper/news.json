Justice N Sathish Kumar said the prosecution's materials did not show that the accused used criminal force, committed any offence, or interfered with anyone's rights. According to the complaint, the men had installed an LED screen outside a temple to stream the event, allegedly causing traffic congestion. The high court held there were no specific allegations or evidence to support charges, observing that gatherings for religious functions cannot be criminalised merely because some groups raise grievances.\n\nEnd of Article",
