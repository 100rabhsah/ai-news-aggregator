    "content": "Representative image\n\nBAREILLY: A 22-year-old man, Mohd Mehboob, suffered severe burn injuries and is in a critical condition after three unidentified men allegedly tied him to a pole, poured petrol on him and set him on fire while he was returning from a mosque after offering Friday namaz. As the ropes got burned, he could free himself and managed to reach home. His family rushed him to the nearby community health centre, which referred him to another hospital. Mehboob’s father, Abdul Sattar, claimed his son suffered 50% burns. The family has filed a complaint, but no FIR has been registered yet. Budaun SP (Rural) Hridesh Katheria said, “It seems the attackers first poured petrol on the man and set him on fire. The victim told police that he had an argument with the accused men Thursday. Three suspects have been detained for questioning.” “All aspects of the case are being probed,” said SP Katheria.\n\nEnd of Article",

    "content": "Representative image\n\nKANPUR: A bike stunt by four youths on Thursday claimed the life of a 23-year-old woman on the Ganga Barrage in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh. Bhavika Gupta, the victim, had gone to the barrage with her friend on a two-wheeler on Thursday evening. Her family said she was just a few metres away from the barrage when four youths on two bikes came speeding, and one of them rammed into her scooter. Bhavika was dragged for at least 50m, her family said, adding the bikes were cruising at 110 km/hr. Bhavika died at the hospital. The youths fled leaving behind one sports bike. The vehicle bore the social media details of one Brijesh Nishad. When checked, the photo of a youth on a sports bike was found. Below the post were some comments wanting to know \"whether he (Brijesh) was alive after the accident at Ganga Barrage\". Police are on the look out for the accused. tnn\n\nEnd of Article",
