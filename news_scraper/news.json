    "content": "Stephen A. breaks down why the Bengals missing the playoffs is a problem with the organization, not Joe Burrow. (1:03) CINCINNATI -- The  Cincinnati Bengals  released RB  Zack Moss  on Wednesday, the team announced. Moss, 27, started training camp on the non-football injury list after suffering a season-ending neck injury last season. In 2024, Moss signed a two-year deal with the Bengals worth $8 million. After last season, Moss and Cincinnati agreed to a restructured deal worth $1.7 million in 2025. Wednesday's release will cost the Bengals $1.88 million in dead money against the salary cap and net Cincinnati $1.2 million in cap savings. In eight games last season, Moss rushed for 242 yards and two touchdowns while splitting reps with  Chase Brown . This offseason, Cincinnati signed running back  Samaje Perine  and drafted former Texas Tech tailback  Tahj Brooks  in the sixth round.",
