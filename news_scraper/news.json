    "content": "Bengaluru: A 35-year-old dance instructor, who participated in TV reality shows and ran a dance school, was killed after he was knocked down by a speeding truck on Tumakuru Road near Pemmanahalli village Tuesday. The deceased, Sudheendra, had gone to his elder brother's house Monday evening after he purchased a Maruti Suzuki Eeco minivan. He stayed overnight with his brother and was on his way back home Tuesday. Dobbespet police said Sudheendra's new vehicle broke down near Pemmanahalli village on the highway at 7.15am. With the help of commuters, he pushed the van to the extreme left of the road and called his brother. But a speeding truck hit Sudheendra and the van. CCTV footage shows the truck was in the middle lane, but the driver lost control and drove to the extreme left and hit Sudheendra and the van. The truck driver, Pitha Kumar, 22, from Tamil Nadu, has been arrested.\n\nEnd of Article",
