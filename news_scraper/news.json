Political observers said after a week of parlays, deputy CM Eknath Shinde had held sway and got BJP to agree to a 'respectable' figure. \"Our talks are over. We will now campaign jointly and make sure Mahayuti's mayor is anointed in BMC. Smaller allies will be given tickets by us from our quota,\" said Mumbai BJP chief MLA Ameet Satam. Sena's Rahul Shewale said talks were positive and a good seat-sharing formula was finalised. Earlier on Monday, BJP had distributed AB forms to candidates without declaring any official list. Till Monday evening, Sena too had not released any official list of candidates but it gave out AB forms to some aspirants to file nominations on Tuesday.\n\nEnd of Article",
