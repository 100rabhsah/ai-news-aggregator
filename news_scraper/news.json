    "content": "A tier-wise snapshot from Mercer | Mettl’s India’s Graduate Skill Index 2025 shows Tier-1 colleges lead overall employability. But the gap doesn’t behave the same across roles. Technical employability is relatively close across tiers. Non-tech roles widen the spread. That suggests hiring rewards workplace-ready performance—writing, presentation, judgement—often shaped by campus exposure. For colleges, the message for colleges is that build this training into daily teaching and assessment, not as a last-minute add-on.",
