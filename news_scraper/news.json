An impressive class in the transfer portal, including the addition of former Tennessee quarterback  Nico Iamaleava , seemed like a solid foundation for Year 2 of Foster, who rallied the Bruins to post victories in four out the last six games to end last season. But the season couldn't have started off any worse. In the Rose Bowl, on opening might, the Bruins fell to Utah, 43-10. A week later, at UNLV, they stumbled again, dropping a 30-23 decision. But those losses were just lead-ins to a puzzling 35-10 defeat at the hands of New Mexico in Week 3 at the Rose Bowl. The Bruins, through three weeks, did not top 23 points in any game, and had allowed at least 30 in all three losses. Foster had a 5-10 record in the 15 games he coached for the Bruins.",
