The searches led to the discovery of an arms cache concealed beneath a natural cave, the post said. “One big IED weighing 4.5kg, one small IED weighing 800g, two Chinese grenades, one 9mm pistol, two 9mm rounds, and 22 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition were recovered from the site,” an Army spokesperson said. The explosives and ammunition were destroyed in situ by a bomb disposal team.\n\nEnd of Article",
