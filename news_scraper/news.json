    "content": "Gab Marcotti reacts to Jadon Sancho's decision to return to Man United after his loan at Chelsea. (0:44) Manchester United  have upped their offer for  Brentford  forward  Bryan Mbeumo , sources have told ESPN. United have already seen the offer of an overall package of around £55 million ($74.5m) knocked back by Brentford. Sources have told ESPN that the improved offer is worth more than £60m. United are pushing to get the deal done as quickly as possible. They've already agreed to trigger the £62.5m release clause in  Matheus Cunha 's contract at Wolves. The Brazilian will formally complete his move to Old Trafford after the international break. Mbeumo, who scored 20  Premier League  goals last season, is next on Ruben Amorim's list as he looks to cure his team's goalscoring problems. According to sources, club bosses have been made aware that the 25-year-old favours a move to United despite interest from Newcastle.",
