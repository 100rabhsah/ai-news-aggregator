    "content": "College football's national signing day kicked off Wednesday with the  early signing period .  Class of 2026  high school recruits who signed have locked into the college of their choice for at least the next year. The drama started early when Vanderbilt  flipped  five-star QB  Jared Curtis  from Georgia on Tuesday night. There are only eight ESPN 300 prospects who remain uncommitted, notably defensive end  Jordan Carter  (No. 57), the top uncommitted player, and QB  Peyton Falzone  (No. 225) who is the lone ranked, uncommitted quarterback. He decommitted from  Auburn  on Monday. If a prospect doesn't sign a national letter of intent by Friday, the next national signing day for this cycle begins Feb. 4. We are tracking the news, analysis and more throughout Wednesday. More:   Live class rankings updates  |  How the five-stars fit",
