The newlyweds had exchanged garlands minutes earlier. Suresh Prasad, the bride’s father, alleged that the groom’s family used rasgullas as an excuse to cause trouble after he rejected their demand for an additional Rs 2 lakh as dowry. “Several people from our side were injured in the attack. We have registered a complaint at Bodh Gaya police station,” he said. Mahendra Prasad of Hathiyawan village, whose son was marrying Suresh’s daughter, contested the allegation. “The girl’s family broke off the wedding over the rasgulla dispute. Now, they are saying it was because of dowry. We still want to bring home our son’s bride,” he said.\n\nEnd of Article",
