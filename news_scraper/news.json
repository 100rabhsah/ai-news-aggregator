This year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry is actually pretty easy to get — and no, it doesn’t involve blue crystals or an RV in the desert. The 2025 Nobel went to Richard Robson, Susumu Kitagawa, and Omar Yaghi for inventing something called metal–organic frameworks, or MOFs. If that sounds like chemistry jargon designed to make you feel stupid, relax. MOFs are basically sponges made of metal and carbon, but on a molecular level — invisible, perfect, and outrageously clever.",
