BJP's Ravi Shankar Prasad mounted a fresh attack on RJD, including its president Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi, besides Tejashwi, after a special court framed charges against them in a suspected scam in IRCTC when the RJD supremo was railway minister. \"It is a historic day, and corruption of RJD's ruling family has been exposed again,\" he said. In a swipe at Tejashwi, seen as the chief ministerial face of opposition alliance, Prasad said he is going to change Bihar with the charge of Section 420 of IPC (dealing with cheating). \"Eating fodder, drinking bitumen, manipulation in award of govt contracts and acquiring land by promising jobs was Lalu's time-tested model of governance,\" he alleged.\n\nEnd of Article",
