Pereira immediately walked Ankalaev down, backing him up near the fence before dropping Ankalaev with a punch and finishing the fight with ground-and-pound on the mat. With the win, Pereira became the third fighter to win the light heavyweight title multiple times. Ankalaev had previously beat Pereira by unanimous decision at UFC 313 to win the belt earlier this year. In the co-main event,  Merab Dvalishvili  earned his  third UFC men's bantamweight title defense , beating  Cory Sandhagen  by unanimous decision. Dvalishvili dropped the first round to the challenger but found his rhythm in Round 2 and never looked back, scoring 20 takedowns and nearly knocking out Sandhagen en route to the victory. Brett Okamoto, Andreas Hale and Jeff Wagenheim break down all the action at UFC 320.",
