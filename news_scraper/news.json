Raja Singh Amera claims to be a spokesperson of Karni Sena. But both Karni Sena and BJP have distanced themselves, stating he has no formal ties to either organisation. Birla is Kota's BJP MP. In the 0.55-second video clip, Amera said he and others would vandalise the MPs' homes and shoot them \"one by one.\" He also said the administration would be responsible if such an act took place. Kota City SP Tejeshwani Goutam said Amera faced four previous cases. The fresh case has been registered under sections 351, 352 and 353 of BNS, pertaining to criminal intimidation, breach of public peace and mischief.\n\nEnd of Article",
