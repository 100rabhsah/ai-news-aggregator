    "content": "NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday declined to entertain Subramanian Swamy's plea to restrain the Andhra Pradesh govt from conducting an administrative inquiry to identify lapses and fasten responsibility on officers resulting in alleged adulteration of 'laddu' prasadam of Tirupati temple. Swamy's counsel said as the court had already constituted an SIT to probe the controversy surrounding the alleged adulteration of prasadam, the administrative inquiry would overlap and possibly interfere in the investigations. For CBI, whose officers are part of the SIT along with officials from Andhra police and FSSAI, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the SIT has completed investigations and filed chargesheet in the case. For state govt, advocate Sidharth Luthra told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi the administrative inquiry and criminal probes by the SIT operated on different spheres and there was no question of any overlap.\n\nEnd of Article",
