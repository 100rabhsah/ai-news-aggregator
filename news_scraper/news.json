Sameer Rizvi, on the other hand, is also playing a fiery knock as three-down DC are cruising vs CSK in their IPL 2025 game in Chennai. Abhishek Porel scored 33 off 20 while Axar Patel slammed 21 off 14. Earlier, Delhi Capitals (DC) skipper Axar Patel won the toss and opted to bat. Ahead of the toss, there were speculations that veteran MS Dhoni will be leading CSK in the game as their regular skipper sustained an injury in the previous game. However, the rumours were dismissed at the toss as Gaikwad came in to lead. DC have named Sameer Rizvi in the Playing XI, who replaced an injured Faf du Plessis. On the other hand, CSK named Devon Conway in the place of Jamie Overton and Mukesh Chaudhary in place of Rahul Tripathi.
