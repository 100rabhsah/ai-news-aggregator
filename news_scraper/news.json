Once united by promises to end “stupid wars,” the movement is now split between anti-war voices like Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, and Matt Gaetz, and hawkish figures like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Vice President JD Vance remains loyally silent, echoing Trump’s shifting stance. With the base wary of another Middle Eastern conflict, Trump’s strategy of maximum pressure without direct action is being tested. The bigger battle may not be with Tehran—but within MAGA itself, as its identity fractures over the meaning of “America First.”",
