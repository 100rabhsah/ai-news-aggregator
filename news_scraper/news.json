After Team USA women's ice hockey won gold against Canada in a thrilling match on Thursday, the American men followed up by advancing to the gold medal match by defeating Slovakia on Friday. They'll have a day off before facing Canada in the gold medal match Sunday, the last event of the 2026 Winter Olympics before the closing ceremony. That's not to say there was nothing happening on Saturday. Team USA women's curling fell short in a bronze medal match against Canada, and Mia Manganello won a bronze medal in the mass start, the U.S.'s first medal in that event.
