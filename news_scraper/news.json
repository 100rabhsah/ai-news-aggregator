Meanwhile, police continued inspections of SIM card vending outlets across Kathua district for the second consecutive day on Sunday. “This initiative aims to strengthen the verification process for new SIM registrations and curb the potential misuse of mobile connectivity,” the official added. Vendors were instructed to maintain accurate records of all transactions and strictly follow procedures for collecting and verifying identity documents such as Aadhaar cards, voter IDs, and other valid proofs. SSP Mohita Sharma said negligence or non-compliance with KYC guidelines could invite strict action, including legal proceedings.\n\nEnd of Article",

The deceased - chief petty officer Vishnu Raghunathan, 27, and petty officer Ananth Krishnan, 18, both from Kerala - were in Bhopal for a training camp with their naval unit. Raghunathan had won the gold medal in the 1000 m K-2 category at the 2024 Asia Cup in Hong Kong and earlier secured a bronze at an open international championship held in Bhopal in 2019. Rohit Nagar SHO said the accident occurred near Mubarakpur toll plaza between 2.30 am and 3 am. The truck sped away after the collision. Police said toll booth records and CCTV footage are being examined to identify and trace the truck and its driver.\n\nEnd of Article",
