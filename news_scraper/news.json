TOI has learnt that a day-long conference was held for all secretary-level officers last week. Top bureaucrats, including the principal secretaries to the PM - P K Mishra and Shaktikanta Das - and cabinet secretary T V Somantahan, gave detailed presentations. Later this week, a similar programme will be held for additional and joint secretaries, while directors will be sensitised next week. \"There is serious thinking on roping in influencers and artistes as they could have more impact than traditional govt communication,\" said an official, adding that plans are afoot to set up rapid response units within ministries.\n\nEnd of Article",
