    "content": "Representative image\n\nNEW DELHI: After an over fiveyear lull, India and China will ramp up their direct air connectivity. IndiGo Saturday announced a daily direct flight between Delhi and Guangzhou from Nov 10, shortly after the airline links Kolkata and Guangzhou from October 26. Air India is also set to fly to China before the end of the year and many Chinese carriers will have India flights. IndiGo has been among the first airlines to reinstate flights between the two countries. In 2019, India and China had 539 direct flights operated by airlines including Air India, IndiGo, China Southern and China Eastern. In March 2020, flights were halted during Covid. Since then, travelling between India and China meant doing so through a third country. On October 2, aviation ministry said direct flights “follow continuous technical-level engagement between civil aviation authorities as part of broader efforts to normalise ties.”\n\nEnd of Article",
